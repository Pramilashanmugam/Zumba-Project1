# Testing

## Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

* Steps to test:

  * Open browser and navigate to [Zumba for Fitness](https://pramilashanmugam.github.io/Zumba-Project1/)
  * Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
  * Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px.
  * Set the zoom to 50%.
  * Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width.

* Manual Testing on Registration form

* Challenges faced during Testing
   * datas entered in comment section was not reflecting in the database, after analysing the code found the error of missing 'name' attribute in textarea and rectified.
   * datas entered in input field was invisible, identified the issue was due to the color choice of input values and same rectified.
   * initially didn't add required attribute to input field hence the form was accepted even when it was blank, same rectified after including required attribute.


## Validator Testing

* ### HTML
   * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
* ### CSS
   * No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
